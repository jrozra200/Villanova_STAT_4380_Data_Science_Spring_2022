# Getting Started with `R` and `RStudio`

This class requires that you have the R programming langugage and the RStudio 
Interactive Development Enviroment (IDE) installed on your computer. We will be 
leveraging RStudio for all facets of this class. 

I have written my own instructions below, but the book outlines this in 
[Appendix B](https://mdsr-book.github.io/mdsr2e/ch-R.html#appR:install).

1. [Install R](#install-r)
2. [Install RStudio](#install-rstudio)
3. [Install Initial R Packages](#install-r-packages)

## Install R

R is the programming language we are using and is required to be installed first.

Go to your favorite [R Project](https://www.r-project.org)
[Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) Mirror Site](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html)
and choose your preferred mirror. I usually use
[the one from Carnegie Mellon](http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/R/CRAN/). On the mirror
site, you'll see download links for your Operating System. Download the right
one and follow the installation instructions.

I think I set mine up using [`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/r) 
(for Mac users only - also, this is *may be* more advanced). 

## Install RStudio

Go to the
[RStudio downloads page](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
and pick the right installer for you. Download and follow the instructions. Now,
we are ready to start playing with `R`.

[`homebrew`](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/rstudio) also offers an option via cask.
