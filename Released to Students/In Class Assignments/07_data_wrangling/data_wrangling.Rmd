Part 1: Load the `ordway_birds` dataset and explore the data. What shape is the 
data (how many rows/columns)?

```{r load_data}


```

Part 2: What columns are in the dataset? You can use the `names()` function to 
do this. 

```{r data_names}


```

Part 3: Create a new dataset that selects, in this order, the `BandNumber`, 
`Age`, `Weight`, `Temperature`, `TailLength`, `Sex`, `SpeciesName`, and `TrapID`.

```{r new_cols}


```

Part 4: Create another new dataset that only has rows where the temperature is 
not blank.

```{r new_rows}


```

Part 5: Using a pipeline, combine part 3 and part 4 to create a final dataset 
that only has the columns listed in 3 and rows desired in 4. 

```{r new_cols_and_rows}


```
