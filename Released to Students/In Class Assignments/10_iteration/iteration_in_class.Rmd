1. Use the `HELPrct` data from the `mosaicData` package to calculate the mean of 
all numeric variables (be sure to exclude missing values).
2. You have data about flight delays in a tibble called `flights` from the 
`nycflights13` package. Write a function that, for any given airport code (e.g., 
LGA), will return a tibble with two columns, the airport code, and the average 
arrival delay time. 
3. Using the appropriate `map` function, create return a data frame with every 
airport code and its average arrival delay time. Arrange the results from the 
most delayed to the least. (use the function you just created above)
