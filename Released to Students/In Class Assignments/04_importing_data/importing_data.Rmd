Step 1: Load the `tidyverse` package.

```{r setup, include = FALSE}

```

Step2: Download the file `titanic.csv` from the datasets directory on Google 
Drive. Read it into R using `read_csv()` from the readr package. Explore the 
data to make sure it was read in properly.

```{r read_csv}


```


Step 3: Compare the file when you read it in using `read.csv()` (base `R`) 
versus `read_csv()` (`readr`). After exploring, what do you see different? 

```{r read.csv}


```

Step 4: Download the file `manufacturing.xlsx` from the datasets directory on 
Google Drive.  Read it into R using `read_xlsx()` from the `readxl` package. 
Explore the data to make sure it was read in properly.

```{r readxl}





```
