# Update the YAML Header

Go into the YAML Header above and:

1. Add your name as the author
2. Make the title "My first Rmd"
3. Add today's date or (optionally) add in the r command to dynamically add 
today's date
4. (Optionally) add a table of contents

# Our First Code Chunk

By now, we should have installed `tidyverse` and `mdsr`. Load those packages 
here, in the first chunk. That is best practice. 

```{r setup}
library(tidyverse)
library(mdsr)
```

# The Next Chunk

Click the green arrow on the top right of the chunk below. What happens? (Write 
your response in the area below the chunk.)

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
It tells us a summary of our speed and distance of the cars variable.

# Our First Plot

Click the green arrow on the top right of the chunk below. What happens? (Write 
your response in the area below the chunk.)

```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

# Creating our First Chunk

Create an `r` code chunk below. Name it something meaningful. Then add code in 
the chunk that subtracts 10 from 5. 

```{r something_meaning}
5 - 10
```

# Create Another Chunk

Create an `r` code chunk below. Name it something meaningful. Also, this time 
add an option so that the code is not shown in the knitted output (only the 
output). Inside the chunk, put the following code to plot a histogram: 
`hist(runif(1000))`.

```{r also_something_meaningful}
hist(runif(1000))
```

# Running Code In-Line

Below this text, create some in-line code that evaluates 100 divided by 39. 

Here is some in-line code `r 100 / 39`.

# Knit This File

Finally - first save this file to a proper location with a proper name, then 
knit this file to both `html` and `docx`.
