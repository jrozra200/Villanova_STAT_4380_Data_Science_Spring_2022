Enter the following data and assign it to a variable called `prediet`: 140, 160, 
135, 120, 125, 165, 108, 130, 225, 140, 180.

```{r}

```


Enter the following data and assign it to a variable called `postdiet`: 139, 
155, 120, 118, 123, 155, 108, 129, 195, 142, 176

```{r}

```

Calculate the weight loss (from `prediet` to `postdiet`).

```{r}

```

Print (only) the 5th element of weight loss using `[]` notation.

```{r}

```

Convert this value to kilograms (2.2 pounds is a kilogram)

```{r}

```

Verify that the kilograms is a numeric variable using `class()`.

```{r}

```

Assemble all four variables into a data frame using `data.frame()`.

```{r}

```


Find the find the `mean`, `median`, `minimum`, and `maximum` of the weight loss 
in kilograms using a summary statistic function for each one.

```{r}

```


Use the `summary()` command to get all the summary statistics for the weight loss 
variable in kilograms. (add a chunk)


Use an if…else statement to create a new variable called `weightgain` which 
equals “lost” if they lost weight and “gain” otherwise. Verify that it’s a 
character variable by using the `is.character()` function. (add a chunk)


Conduct the appropriate statistical inference to determine whether the weight 
loss program was effective. State the assumptions/conditions for this test and 
verify them. (We haven't yet talked about graphics, but you can use the `stem()` 
command to do a basic text-based graphic or try `hist()`. (add a chunk)
