## Overview


**Due:**                 Week 10 (March 15 & 17)  
**Teams:**               You may choose your team of 2; will be randomly 
assigned on Tuesday (if you don't have a partner)  
**Presentation Order:**  Will be randomly selected  
**Presentation Length:** 16 minutes  

## Instructions

1. Find a data visualization and the data to build it 
    - I recommend using the 
    [Makover Monday (MoM) Website](https://www.makeovermonday.co.uk/data/)
2. Recreate the visualization in R as closely as possible
3. Show the original
4. Walk through the steps you've taken to recreate it
5. Show the end results
6. Discuss the shortcomings you'd like to address
7. Submit the slides and RMarkdown code to Blackboard (**BEFORE** you present)

## Evaluation

You'll be evaluated on how close you've come to the data viz you've selected 
and how well you're team worked together (I'm still working out how to evaluate 
that). 

As a gentle reminder, this project is worth 20% of your final grade. 

## Presentation Order

```{r presentation_order, eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
library(dplyr)

seed <- 3172022
set.seed(seed, sample.kind = "default")

all_students <- c("Claude", "Zhipeng", "Jack", "Kevin", "Catherine",
                  "Sofia", "Aelia", "Fiona", "Erin", "Andy", "Andrew", 
                  "Ray", "Nate", "Sarah", "Braeden", "De'ana")

random_order <- sample(all_students, 16, replace = FALSE)

presentation_order <- data.frame(order = 1:length(random_order),
                                 student = random_order,
                                 day = c(rep("day 1", 8), rep("day 2", 8)))

presentation_order %>% 
    kbl(align = "l") %>% 
    kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover"))
```
